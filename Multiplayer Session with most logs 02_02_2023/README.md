# General info

This is runned on a lightly moded server, server was runned by another user

I've picked this one because it has the most instance of `removing stale zombie 5000` (1439 in less than 4 hours)

Why does it have so much ? I know it was on a different map on a day I know I went fighting a lot, the more you fight / move zombies the more likely this happens
